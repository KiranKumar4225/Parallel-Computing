# Parallel-Computing

As part of the MSc Cyber security course, I have completed this module and its coursework has been uploaded. The description of this module is provided below.

On successful completion of this module students will be able to: 
1. Distinguish, contrast, and apply the main concepts of sequential, 
concurrent, and parallel computing. (A) 
2. Be able to critically evaluate and access the effectiveness of parallel 
computation in homogenous and heterogeneous environments. (A&B) 
3. Distinguish, contrast, and reflect between different hardware abstractions 
for parallelism, e.g. multi-core, many-core, and vector architectures. (A) 
4. The ability to develop programs for parallel systems, e.g. using OpenMP for 
single-node, and Cuda for accelerators. (A&B) 
5. Have the ability to understand and develop parallel designs and algorithm 
design and implementation. (A&B)
